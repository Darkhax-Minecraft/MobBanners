=========

his mod adds a new type of banner called the Mob Banner. There is a different variant of this banner for every spawnable mob in the game. These banners are awarded to a player after they successfully kill 50 of the same type of mob. For example, killing 50 zombies will award you with a Zombie banner. Once you have a banner unlocked, you can look at the tooltip of it to see how many mobs you have killed since the mod was installed.
